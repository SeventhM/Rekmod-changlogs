https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y0TXixa2_vnTWUtWDz9g9TIx3NeX4HonY0-7vMhhZgM/edit

### Beliefs
- God of Festivals: +1 Culture, +1 Faith for Wine/Spice/Sugar to +1 Production for Wine/Spice/Sugar
- Goddess of the Fields: +1 Culture, +1 Faith for Incense/Cotton/Tea/Coffee to +2 Faith for Incense/Cotton/Tea/Coffee
- Mystic Rituals: +1 Culture, +1 Faith for Silk/Dye/Perfume/Tobacco to +1 Culture, +1 Food for Silk/Dye/Perfume/Tobacco
- Ritual Sacrifice: +1 Culture, +1 Faith for Ivory/Fur/Truffles to +1 Culture, +2 Gold for Ivory/Fur/Truffles
- Tears of the Gods: +1 Culture, +1 Faith for Jems/Amber/Lapis/Jade to +1 Faith, +2 Gold for Jems/Amber/Lapis/Jade
  <br>***Note: These were all changed to give some personallity to them and not have a bunch of the same effects for each***
- Sun God: Now gives +1 Gold in addition to +1 Food to Citris/Olive/Cocoa/Coconut. It still only givess 1 Food to Bananas
- Stone Circles: Now gives only 1 Faith to quarries in addition to the production. Also gives 1 Faith to Marble/Obsidian
- City of God no longer gives Culture
<br>***Note: Alongside the free prophet, they felt that it became too strong early on. The main goal seems to be to focus more on City of God being a small science/food boost, not a general Holy Site boost***

### Promotions
- Helicopters now have an anti Naval promotion line. +25% Strength vs Water units, at 3 tiers
- Helicopters no longer have Mobility I or Mobility II. However, unlike Lekmod, I have left Helicopters to get the Movement boost after getting 3 promotions

### Civs
- Bulgaria no longer gets science from artist or musician specialists. In return, they now get 5 science from writer specialists instead of 3
- Norway now gives +1 Faith to water resources. They no longer give production to tundra, but now they give +2 Food and +1 Production to Snow instead of just +1 Production
- Siam now has a bias for Rivers instead of forests. I'm not sure if this actually works
- Siam now gets +50% happiness from city states and their resources, in addition to their other benefits

### Buildings
- Bulgaria's UB cost 48 instead of 55
- Tonga's UB no longer gives faith when near coast. It now always gives 1 faith. It still gives food and culture near coast
- Norways's UB no longer gives faith to water resources. Now it gives Production to Snow and Tundra

- Sweden's UB is now unlocked at Metal Casting instead of Machinery

## Corrections
### Policies

### Beliefs

  - Public School cost 380

  - Workshops cost 200
  - Windmills cost 320

- Synagogues now give +15% production to buildings instead of +10% ***Note: this was a nerf the previously did and reverted without noting***
- Guruship now also gives 1 gold in addition to the food and production

### Promotions
- Ambush Formation has been changed. It no longer requires a promotion to get, it has 3 tiers, and now the bonus is 15%, 15%, then 30%. Anything requiring other leveled promotions (such as Shock) can now be gotten after getting Ambush Formation
- Helicopters now need 3 promotions to get Logistics and Air Repair, similar to other units
- Fighters can get Sortie after getting Air Targeting II, similar to its other promotion lines

### Civs
- Any Civs without a coast bias now has a bias to avoid the coast. This is the attempt to match how Lekmod tries to make sure coast bias civs spawn on the coast
- Any Civs that got beneifts to annexed cities now also gets those benefits to puppeted cities. This is to match how Lekmod intends the benefit to be for conquered cities in general
- Armenia now avoids Jungle
- Assyria now gets a free Writer insted of a free Artist. They also get a free great work of writing upon completing a library in their capital
- Brueni now also gets -33% maintenence cost for water units and their water units can also build improvements. Thier UA has also been turned into a promotion in order to function correctly
- Celts and Finland no longer gets their bonuses to improved forests
- Egypt now just has a desert bias instead of avoiding jungle and forest
- The Moor's construction bonus now works as intended. Instead of a flat +10% production, they get +30% in the Medieval era and that drops to +15% in the Renaissance era and beyond
- Ottomans has a completely different UA. Now it's +2 happiness in a city if there's a major religion there
  <br>***Note: The Ottomans seems to have changed drasically at some point and I just never noticed. Their effects aren't entirely possible yet, so this is as close to what I can do for now***
- Romania now gets +10% strength vs wounded foes instead of +20%, and get 25% culture in golden ages instead of +20%
- Rome no longer has a spawn bias (besides avoiding coast)
- Tonga no longer gets sight for all of their units. Now, when they spawn, the will see all coastlines within 10 tiles of their center spawn location

### Buildings
- Indonesian special resource buildings are no longer classified as national wonders
- Timurd's special building to give the capital extra stats no longer is classified as a national wonder

### Units
- Landsknechts and the Papal State's replacement now have 3 movement and no movement cost to pillage. They should also get a bonus from capturing cities and barbarian camps, but that's not possible yet
- I've decided to add in the anti tank rifle. For now, they're using the anti tank gun's sprite. They are an in-between unit between the lancer and the at-gun. 30 stregth unit, on railroads, with +200% strength vs armored units
- Inquisitors and Missionaries now have a set price of 200 Faith that does not increase with ages

### Others
- Wonders added to the mod or otherwise moved around now correctly don't show if you start at a later era
- The gold from gold trade routes has been doubled to make it more worthwhile
